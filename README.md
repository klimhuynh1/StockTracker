To start the React app in development mode, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   To run the app locally and start the development server, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server, and you should be able to view the app at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if specified).

   

3. **View the Application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to see your React app in action.
